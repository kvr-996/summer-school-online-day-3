📝 Assignment: Sticky Blog Layout with CSS Grid
🎯 Objective:
Create a blog layout using CSS Grid for the overall page structure and use position: sticky to make the sidebar menu stick to the top as the user scrolls.

✅ Requirements:
1. Layout Structure (using CSS Grid):
Create a grid layout with:
A Header at the top spanning full width


A Sidebar on the left (for navigation links)


A Main content area on the right


A Footer at the bottom spanning full width


| Header             |
| Sidebar | Main     |
| Footer             |

Use grid-template-areas or grid-template-columns/rows to achieve this.

2. Sidebar with Sticky Navigation (using position: sticky):
Inside the sidebar:
Add a vertical list of 5 blog post titles or categories


Use position: sticky so this menu stays visible when the user scrolls the main content



3. Main Content:
Add 4–5 sections of dummy blog content (can use <h2> and <p>).
 Each section should have enough content to allow scrolling.

4. Styling:
Use different background colors for Header, Sidebar, Main Content, and Footer


Add padding and spacing for readability


Make sure layout is responsive for smaller screens (use minmax() or media queries optionally)
